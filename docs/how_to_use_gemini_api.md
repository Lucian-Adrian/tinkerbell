We are working on building the working production version of this, and I am using KIRO AI, this is the requirements.md he came up with, i feel like these are not going to work, too superficial seems to me, what do i tell the AI.


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right to feel that the requirements outlined here are surface-level and safe‚Äîthey mostly describe basic CRUD functionality and flow UX (e.g., upload pitch deck, view a dashboard, click to export assets), not the deep intelligence or "magic" that Tinkerbell promises in your vision.

Here's what you can tell KIRO AI to redirect it:

üß† Feedback for KIRO AI:
These requirements are functional but too generic and shallow. They describe a basic flow any low-code SaaS tool could build, but they don‚Äôt capture the intellectual engine of Tinkerbell‚Äîits unique power to explore millions of ideas, detect hidden patterns, and deliver surprising but effective creative outcomes.

We need to go beyond UI flows and CRUD tasks. Please rework the requirements to reflect:

Non-obvious Correlation Discovery

How does the AI detect surprising but effective signals between ICPs, channels, message formats, and campaign success?

Can it build and refine a probabilistic success model based on multiple weak signals (e.g., time on site, phrasing in inquiry forms)?

High-Velocity Creative Experimentation Engine

We need a subsystem that generates, launches, and learns from hundreds or thousands of micro-campaigns.

It should be able to mutate images, CTAs, headlines, and targeting options using generative AI + performance feedback.

Live Learning Loop

There must be a feedback engine: campaigns that perform well should reinforce certain attributes; others should be suppressed or remixed.

Think of this as reinforcement learning applied to demand generation.

Contextual Goal-Based Scoring Models

Different businesses will have different success criteria (e.g., DTC = virality; B2B SaaS = high-intent demo probability).

We need to be able to dynamically generate and apply custom scoring models based on business type, not just generic CTR or CPL.

Synthetic ICP Signal Creation

When we don‚Äôt have enough CRM or sales data, how does the system simulate or infer buying intent?

For example: infer intent from LinkedIn roles + dwell time + what form questions they answer and how.

üõ† Specific Next Steps You Could Ask For:
Rewrite the "Autonomous Strategy Generation" module to include signal correlation, probabilistic persona construction, and market whitespace detection.

Add a "Creative Mutation Engine" module that can generate and mutate ad creative at scale, with real-time performance feedback loops.

Define a "Scoring Framework API" that allows a company to define what "success" means (e.g., leads with CFO titles + >60s dwell time), and have the system rank ideas accordingly.

Include technical architecture guidance for multi-agent AI orchestration if using LLMs + specialized models (e.g., GPT + Claude + Retool-like logic agent).

Design for dynamic learning, not just batch generation. Campaigns should evolve over time, not just be generated once.

Would you like me to help you rewrite one of the requirement sections to reflect this deeper AI intelligence and experimentation loop? That might help your AI partner "see" the level you're aiming for.

4. Tech Stack Choices
Our technology choices are optimized for AI-native workloads, development speed, and scalability.
Backend: Python (FastAPI)
Why: Python is the undisputed leader for AI/ML development, providing unparalleled access to libraries and frameworks. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework that enables us to build fast, scalable, and well-documented APIs with minimal boilerplate.
Database: PostgreSQL
Why: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database known for its reliability and robustness. Its native support for the JSONB data type is critical for our architecture, allowing us to efficiently store and query the complex, structured JSON objects returned by our AI models.
Task Queue: Redis
Why: Our AI generation tasks are long-running and cannot be handled in a synchronous API request. Redis is the industry-standard, high-performance in-memory key-value store, perfectly suited to act as a message broker between our API server and our AI workers. This decoupling is essential for a responsive user experience and a scalable system.
AI Models: Google Gemini & Imagen
Why: We are leveraging state-of-the-art models. Gemini is exceptionally powerful for complex reasoning and its ability to return reliable, structured JSON output is the technical linchpin of our entire strategy-generation phase. Imagen provides the capability to generate high-quality, contextually relevant visual assets at scale.
Frontend: Framework Agnostic
Why: The backend is designed to expose a clean, RESTful API. This makes it compatible with any modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) or low-code/no-code builder (e.g., Bolt, Lovable), providing maximum flexibility for UI development.

So we have to pinpoint the gemini documentation and how to call the API, as gemini 2.5 pro 2.5 flash , bot have thinking and both have structured output, we can use imagen 4 for image generation, we need solid prompts for image generation, not to produce some generic AI slop but something actually according to strategy etc.


ChatGPT said:
You‚Äôre on the right path with your architecture and tooling‚Äîit‚Äôs modern, AI-native, and sets you up for scale. But you're also at a critical fork: if you don't define the right abstraction layers and prompting standards now, you‚Äôll end up with a ‚Äúfancy CRUD app with a GPT-API bolted on‚Äù instead of Tinkerbell‚Äîthe strategy-bending AI fairy.

Here‚Äôs how to ground Gemini + Imagen into your system properly, with the depth and power your product narrative demands:

üîç 1. Gemini 2.5 (Pro & Flash): API Groundwork
‚úÖ Step 1: Choose the Right Model for the Job
Task	Model	Why
Deep strategy generation (multi-layer context parsing, market analysis, persona modeling)	Gemini Pro 2.5	Stronger at abstract thinking, multi-turn reasoning, structured output
Fast image prompt iterations or summarization	Gemini Flash 2.5	Cheaper and faster, ideal for simple generation
JSON-formatted output	Both support it, Pro is more reliable under pressure	Structure the prompt to require JSON with schema hints

üì¶ 2. Structured Prompting for Strategy Generation
You need to design your prompts as API payloads, not chatty blurbs.

üéØ Your Goal:
A single call that returns structured data like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "industries": [{ "name": "Fintech", "opportunity_score": 0.83 }, ...],
  "icps": [{
    "title": "VP of Finance",
    "pain_points": ["Manual reporting", "Compliance anxiety"],
    "value_propositions": ["Automated dashboards", "Audit-ready reports"]
  }],
  "angles": ["Counter-intuitive", "Aspirational", "Fear-based"],
  "messages": ["Tired of guessing your cash position? Let AI give you clarity."]
}
üß† Prompt Skeleton (for Gemini Pro 2.5)
txt
Copy
Edit
You are a growth strategist AI. Given a startup website and pitch deck, return a go-to-market strategy.

Input:
- Website: {{URL}}
- Pitch Summary: {{ParsedTextFromDeck}}

Instructions:
- Generate 5-10 target industries with short justifications and opportunity score (0-1)
- Generate 3 Ideal Customer Profiles with title, department, pain points, value props
- Generate 5 messaging angles (tone + goal)
- For each angle, write 2 sample messages

Output format: strict JSON with keys:
industries, icps, angles, messages_by_angle
üñºÔ∏è 3. Imagen 4: Prompt Engineering for Strategy-Based Visuals
You cannot use Imagen like a generic stock photo generator.

You need prompts that tie directly to:

The messaging angle

The ICP persona

The emotional trigger

üß† Example Strategy Input:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "icp": "VP of Finance at Series A B2B SaaS",
  "angle": "Fear-based",
  "message": "How much cash runway do you *really* have?",
  "visual_type": "Social media ad"
}
üéØ Prompt Output for Imagen:
‚ÄúA stressed finance executive sitting at a desk in a modern startup office, with blurred spreadsheets on a screen and red warning indicators showing ‚Äò90 days left‚Äô. Moody lighting. Bold overlay text: ‚ÄòHow much cash runway do you really have?‚Äô‚Äù

‚úÖ Prompt Engineering Rules for Imagen:
Use emotional cues (stressed, delighted, urgent, curious)

Include props/scenery tied to job context (whiteboard, Slack notifications, budget spreadsheets)

Style: always specify lighting, tone, and composition

Avoid vagueness ("a person thinking")‚Äîdescribe the moment before or after a decision

üîÅ 4. What to Ask KIRO AI Now:
Here‚Äôs a prompt you can give your AI collaborator:

üì£ Instructions to KIRO AI:
Rework our Gemini and Imagen integration plan as follows:

Define Gemini prompt schemas for strategy generation that return:

ICPs

Messaging angles

Campaign goals

Industry opportunities

Specific message copy (2 per angle)

All returned in strict JSON format

Define Imagen prompt generation logic:

Use ICP + message + angle + desired emotion to craft rich visual prompts

Include tone, props, emotional intent, overlay text, and call-to-action formatting

Implement a prompt templating system with:

Fallbacks (e.g., if no pitch deck, use website parsing only)

Prompt versioning and feedback loop to rate generated assets

Write wrappers in Python (FastAPI) to:

Call Gemini Pro 2.5 for strategy generation

Call Imagen 4 for creative generation

Handle retry logic and response validation

Be aggressive in assuming AI-native logic‚Äînot just CRUD control panels. Tinkerbell is about discovering and delivering unexpected wins from creative and strategic space, not safe automation.

Would you like me to help write the actual FastAPI endpoints or structured prompt templates next?

üîß Integrating into Tinkerbell Architecture
Model Selection Strategy for Tinkerbell‚Äôs Modules
Task	Model	Thinking Mode
Strategy mapping & ICP modeling	Gemini Pro	thinkingBudget=-1 or high for depth
Tactical message variation or copy rewriting	Gemini Flash	dynamic thinking or zero
Bulk generation of messages or ICP variants	Flash‚ÄëLite	no thinking (faster, cheaper)

Prompt Architecture (Structured)
Use responseSchema via API to define strategy output object, e.g.:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "icps": [{
    "title": "string",
    "pain_points": ["string"],
    "value_props": ["string"]
  }],
  "angles": ["string"],
  "messages_by_angle": { "string": ["string"] },
  "industries": [{ "name": "string", "opportunity_score": "number" }]
}
Pair this with prompts that request output only in JSON, no explanatory text.
Google AI for Developers

Imagen Prompt Templates
Each ad prompt input includes:

ICP descriptor (e.g., ‚ÄúVP Finance, Series A SaaS‚Äù)

Angle + message copy

Emotion cue (e.g. ‚Äúurgent‚Äù, ‚Äúanxious‚Äù)

Visual context props (office, spreadsheets, dashboards)

Overlay text style options (bold CTA text, headline layout)

Then generate visual prompt that ties directly to the strategy context (e.g. ‚Äúexpress anxiety about cash runway with red indicators flowing across desk‚Äù)

what about using fast models like imagen 4 fast for previews and generating images, then when selecting or posting campaigns we may ask if another, higher quality image is expected?
look here for more precise pricing and more models we may decide upon...
https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing#imagen-models


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right‚Äîusing a faster, lower-cost Imagen variant for previewing images and swapping in higher-quality versions later is both practical and smart for a system like Tinkerbell that needs both speed and polish. Here's how you could integrate that into your design, with accurate pricing and model options from Vertex AI:

‚ö° Tiered Image Generation Workflow
1. Imagen 4 Fast for Initial Drafts
Generate preview assets quickly and cheaply using a fast, lower-quality mode (if available).

These previews allow users to rapidly browse creative variations and iterate.

2. Ask Before Finalization
If a campaign is selected for deployment, prompt either the user or the system AI to ask:

"Would you like a higher-fidelity version?"

If yes, rerun the generation through Imagen 4 Standard or Ultra for polish.

üí∏ Imagen 4 Pricing Reference (Vertex AI Paid Tier)
Model Variant	Price per Image
Imagen 4 Standard	~$0.04
Imagen 4 Ultra	~$0.06
Wikipedia

arXiv
+3

That means preview images cost pennies, while ultra‚Äëquality final outputs remain affordable but noticeably better.

üß† Model Context & Use Cases
Snapshots (fast mode): Ideal for hypothesis exploration‚Äîcheap, fast, sufficient resolution.

Refined Outputs (standard/ultra): For final campaign assets, ads, presentations, etc. 
Firebase
Wikipedia

The Firebase AI Logic guide suggests choosing Imagen specifically when image quality is mission-critical, versus Gemini-based generation for fast or blended multimodal use.

üîó Integration Blueprint for Tinkerbell
Preview Layer

Default end of message generation ‚Üí send prompts via Imagen 4 Standard or Ultra-fast option (if available)

Use fastest/cost-effective quality tier

Selection Logic

When a campaign is chosen, the system prompts:

"Upgrade this image to high-quality (Ultra)?"

Final Re-generation

If confirmed, reissue the prompt via Imagen 4 Ultra

Replace preview image in dashboard or campaign export

Audit Trail

Log both preview and final outputs

Allow version rollback if needed

üîÅ Technical Touchpoints in FastAPI or AI Engine
A single FastAPI endpoint POST /generate-asset-preview (uses fast tier)

Another endpoint POST /generate-final-image (uses high-quality tier)

Both share prompt templating logic, differ only in model parameter

‚úÖ Why This Approach Fits Tinkerbell
Speed-first: Enables exploration, experimentation, mass creative iteration

Budget-conscious: Keeps cost low for previews

Quality Optionality: Gives users control when fidelity matters

Aligned with product promise: Fast iteration to discover magic, polished execution when it matters

Would you like example FastAPI endpoint code using these model choices? Or a prompt templating module that can dynamically pick the model tier based on campaign state?

This means you can feed Gemini URLs directly (like a company website or news article), and it will retrieve and ingest the page content as part of its context.

Use cases:

Extract ICP traits or messaging cues from a target‚Äôs website.

Aggregate competitor features across multiple links.

Summarize pitch deck URLs.

üß™ Python Example: Strategy with URL Context
python
Copy

from google import genai
from google.genai.types import GenerateContentConfig, Tool, UrlContext

client = genai.Client()

# Define url context tool
url_tool = Tool(url_context=UrlContext())

prompt = (
    "Based on the following URL, generate a structured go-to-market strategy:\n"
    "URL: https://example.com\n"
    "Return JSON with industries, ICPs, angles, and messaging."
)

config = GenerateContentConfig(
    tools=[url_tool],
    response_modalities=["TEXT"]

    contents=prompt,
    config=config
)

print(response.candidates[0].content.text)
print("Context metadata:", response.candidates[0].url_context_metadata)
Gemini fetches the content from the URL automatically.

feedbackGenerate images using Imagen

Imagen is Google's high-fidelity image generation model, capable of generating realistic and high quality images from text prompts. All generated images include a SynthID watermark. To learn more about the available Imagen model variants, see the Model versions section.

Note: You can also generate images with Gemini's built-in multimodal capabilities. See the Image generation guide for details.
Generate images using the Imagen models
This example demonstrates generating images with an Imagen model:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_images(
    model='imagen-4.0-generate-preview-06-06',
    prompt='Robot holding a red skateboard',
    config=types.GenerateImagesConfig(
        number_of_images= 4,
    )
)
for generated_image in response.generated_images:
  generated_image.image.show()
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
Imagen configuration
Imagen supports English only prompts at this time and the following parameters:

Note: Naming conventions of parameters vary by programming language.
numberOfImages: The number of images to generate, from 1 to 4 (inclusive). The default is 4. For Imagen 4 Ultra, it defaults to 1 as only one image can be generated at a time.
aspectRatio: Changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. Supported values are "1:1", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", and "16:9". The default is "1:1".
personGeneration: Allow the model to generate images of people. The following values are supported:

"dont_allow": Block generation of images of people.
"allow_adult": Generate images of adults, but not children. This is the default.
"allow_all": Generate images that include adults and children.
Note: The "allow_all" parameter value is not allowed in EU, UK, CH, MENA locations.
Imagen prompt guide
This section of the Imagen guide shows you how modifying a text-to-image prompt can produce different results, along with examples of images you can create.

Prompt writing basics
Note: Maximum prompt length is 480 tokens.
A good prompt is descriptive and clear, and makes use of meaningful keywords and modifiers. Start by thinking of your subject, context, and style.

Prompt with subject, context, and style emphasized
Image text: A sketch (style) of a modern apartment building (subject) surrounded by skyscrapers (context and background).
Subject: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the subject: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.

Context and background: Just as important is the background or context in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or indoor environments.

Style: Finally, add the style of image you want. Styles can be general (painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal drawing, isometric 3D). You can also combine styles.

After you write a first version of your prompt, refine your prompt by adding more details until you get to the image that you want. Iteration is important. Start by establishing your core idea, and then refine and expand upon that core idea until the generated image is close to your vision.

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers
Imagen models can transform your ideas into detailed images, whether your prompts are short or long and detailed. Refine your vision through iterative prompting, adding details until you achieve the perfect result.

Short prompts let you generate an image quickly.

Imagen 3 short prompt example
Prompt: close-up photo of a woman in her 20s, street photography, movie still, muted orange warm tones
Longer prompts let you add specific details and build your image.

Imagen 3 long prompt example
Prompt: captivating photo of a woman in her 20s utilizing a street photography style. The image should look like a movie still with muted orange warm tones.
Additional advice for Imagen prompt writing:

Use descriptive language: Employ detailed adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Imagen.
Provide context: If necessary, include background information to aid the AI's understanding.
Reference specific artists or styles: If you have a particular aesthetic in mind, referencing specific artists or art movements can be helpful.
Use prompt engineering tools: Consider exploring prompt engineering tools or resources to help you refine your prompts and achieve optimal results.
Enhancing the facial details in your personal and group images: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo (for example, use the word "portrait" in the prompt).
Generate text in images
Imagen models can add text into images, opening up more creative image generation possibilities. Use the following guidance to get the most out of this feature:

Iterate with confidence: You might have to regenerate images until you achieve the look you want. Imagen's text integration is still evolving, and sometimes multiple attempts yield the best results.
Keep it short: Limit text to 25 characters or less for optimal generation.
Multiple phrases: Experiment with two or three distinct phrases to provide additional information. Avoid exceeding three phrases for cleaner compositions.

Imagen 3 generate text example
Prompt: A poster with the text "Summerland" in bold font as a title, underneath this text is the slogan "Summer never felt so good"
Guide Placement: While Imagen can attempt to position text as directed, expect occasional variations. This feature is continually improving.

Inspire font style: Specify a general font style to subtly influence Imagen's choices. Don't rely on precise font replication, but expect creative interpretations.

Font size: Specify a font size or a general indication of size (for example, small, medium, large) to influence the font size generation.

Prompt parameterization
To better control output results, you might find it helpful to parameterize the inputs into Imagen. For example, suppose you want your customers to be able to generate logos for their business, and you want to make sure logos are always generated on a solid color background. You also want to limit the options that the client can select from a menu.

In this example, you can create a parameterized prompt similar to the following:


A {logo_style} logo for a {company_area} company on a solid color background. Include the text {company_name}.
In your custom user interface, the customer can input the parameters using a menu, and their chosen value populates the prompt Imagen receives.

For example:

Prompt: A minimalist logo for a health care company on a solid color background. Include the text Journey.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 1

Prompt: A modern logo for a software company on a solid color background. Include the text Silo.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 2

Prompt: A traditional logo for a baking company on a solid color background. Include the text Seed.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 3

Advanced prompt writing techniques
Use the following examples to create more specific prompts based on attributes like photography descriptors, shapes and materials, historical art movements, and image quality modifiers.

Photography
Prompt includes: "A photo of..."
To use this style, start with using keywords that clearly tell Imagen that you're looking for a photograph. Start your prompts with "A photo of. . .". For example:

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A photo of coffee beans in a kitchen on a wooden surface
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A photo of a chocolate bar on a kitchen counter
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A photo of a modern building with water in the background
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Photography modifiers
In the following examples, you can see several photography-specific modifiers and parameters. You can combine multiple modifiers for more precise control.

Camera Proximity - Close up, taken from far away


close up camera sample image
Prompt: A close-up photo of coffee beans
zoomed out camera sample image
Prompt: A zoomed out photo of a small bag of
coffee beans in a messy kitchen
Camera Position - aerial, from below

aerial photo sample image
Prompt: aerial photo of urban city with skyscrapers
a view from underneath sample image
Prompt: A photo of a forest canopy with blue skies from below
Lighting - natural, dramatic, warm, cold

natural lighting sample image
Prompt: studio photo of a modern arm chair, natural lighting
dramatic lighting sample image
Prompt: studio photo of a modern arm chair, dramatic lighting
Camera Settings - motion blur, soft focus, bokeh, portrait

motion blur sample image
Prompt: photo of a city with skyscrapers from the inside of a car with motion blur
soft focus sample image
Prompt: soft focus photograph of a bridge in an urban city at night
Lens types - 35mm, 50mm, fisheye, wide angle, macro

macro lens sample image
Prompt: photo of a leaf, macro lens
fisheye lens sample image
Prompt: street photography, new york city, fisheye lens
Film types - black and white, polaroid

polaroid photo sample image
Prompt: a polaroid portrait of a dog wearing sunglasses
black and white photo sample image
Prompt: black and white photo of a dog wearing sunglasses
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Illustration and art
Prompt includes: "A painting of...", "A sketch of..."
Art styles vary from monochrome styles like pencil sketches, to hyper-realistic digital art. For example, the following images use the same prompt with different styles:

"An [art style or creation technique] of an angular sporty electric sedan with skyscrapers in the background"

art sample images
Prompt: A technical pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A charcoal drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A color pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A pastel painting of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A digital art of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: An art deco (poster) of an angular...
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 2 model.

Shapes and materials
Prompt includes: "...made of...", "...in the shape of..."
One of the strengths of this technology is that you can create imagery that is otherwise difficult or impossible. For example, you can recreate your company logo in different materials and textures.

shapes and materials example image 1
Prompt: a duffle bag made of cheese
shapes and materials example image 2
Prompt: neon tubes in the shape of a bird
shapes and materials example image 3
Prompt: an armchair made of paper, studio photo, origami style
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Historical art references
Prompt includes: "...in the style of..."
Certain styles have become iconic over the years. The following are some ideas of historical painting or art styles that you can try.

"generate an image in the style of [art period or movement] : a wind farm"

impressionism example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of an impressionist painting: a wind farm
renaissance example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of a renaissance painting: a wind farm
pop art example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of pop art: a wind farm
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Image quality modifiers
Certain keywords can let the model know that you're looking for a high-quality asset. Examples of quality modifiers include the following:

General Modifiers - high-quality, beautiful, stylized
Photos - 4K, HDR, Studio Photo
Art, Illustration - by a professional, detailed
The following are a few examples of prompts without quality modifiers and the same prompt with quality modifiers.

corn example image without modifiers
Prompt (no quality modifiers): a photo of a corn stalk
corn example image with modifiers
Prompt (with quality modifiers): 4k HDR beautiful
photo of a corn stalk taken by a
professional photographer
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Aspect ratios
Imagen image generation lets you set five distinct image aspect ratios.

Square (1:1, default) - A standard square photo. Common uses for this aspect ratio include social media posts.
Fullscreen (4:3) - This aspect ratio is commonly used in media or film. It is also the dimensions of most old (non-widescreen) TVs and medium format cameras. It captures more of the scene horizontally (compared to 1:1), making it a preferred aspect ratio for photography.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: close up of a musician's fingers playing the piano, black and white film, vintage (4:3 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: A professional studio photo of french fries for a high end restaurant, in the style of a food magazine (4:3 aspect ratio)
Portrait full screen (3:4) - This is the fullscreen aspect ratio rotated 90 degrees. This lets to capture more of the scene vertically compared to the 1:1 aspect ratio.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a woman hiking, close of her boots reflected in a puddle, large mountains in the background, in the style of an advertisement, dramatic angles (3:4 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: aerial shot of a river flowing up a mystical valley (3:4 aspect ratio)
Widescreen (16:9) - This ratio has replaced 4:3 and is now the most common aspect ratio for TVs, monitors, and mobile phone screens (landscape). Use this aspect ratio when you want to capture more of the background (for example, scenic landscapes).

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a man wearing all white clothing sitting on the beach, close up, golden hour lighting (16:9 aspect ratio)
Portrait (9:16) - This ratio is widescreen but rotated. This a relatively new aspect ratio that has been popularized by short form video apps (for example, YouTube shorts). Use this for tall objects with strong vertical orientations such as buildings, trees, waterfalls, or other similar objects.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a digital render of a massive skyscraper, modern, grand, epic with a beautiful sunset in the background (9:16 aspect ratio)
Photorealistic images
Different versions of the image generation model might offer a mix of artistic and photorealistic output. Use the following wording in prompts to generate more photorealistic output, based on the subject you want to generate.

Note: Take these keywords as general guidance when you try to create photorealistic images. They aren't required to achieve your goal.

feedbackFiles API

The Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models is built to handle various types of input data, including text, images, and audio. Since these models can handle more than one type or mode of data, the Gemini models are called multimodal models or explained as having multimodal capabilities.

This guide shows you how to work with media files using the Files API. The basic operations are the same for audio files, images, videos, documents, and other supported file types.

For file prompting guidance, check out the File prompt guide section.

Upload a file
You can use the Files API to upload a media file. Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB.

The following code uploads a file and then uses the file in a call to generateContent.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

myfile = client.files.upload(file="path/to/sample.mp3")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents=["Describe this audio clip", myfile]
)

print(response.text)
Get metadata for a file
You can verify that the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its metadata by calling files.get.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

myfile = client.files.upload(file='path/to/sample.mp3')
file_name = myfile.name
myfile = client.files.get(name=file_name)
print(myfile)
List uploaded files
You can upload multiple files using the Files API. The following code gets a list of all the files uploaded:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

print('My files:')
for f in client.files.list():
    print(' ', f.name)
Delete uploaded files
Files are automatically deleted after 48 hours. You can also manually delete an uploaded file:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

myfile = client.files.upload(file='path/to/sample.mp3')
client.files.delete(name=myfile.name)
Usage info
You can use the Files API to upload and interact with media files. The Files API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a per-file maximum size of 2 GB. Files are stored for 48 hours. During that time, you can use the API to get metadata about the files, but you can't download the files. The Files API is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is available.

File prompting strategies
This section provides guidance and best practices for using media files with prompts for the Gemini API.

Being able to use various types of data in your prompts gives you more flexibility in terms of what tasks you can tackle with the Gemini API. For example, you can send the model a photo of a delicious meal and ask it to write a short blog about the meal.

Prompt	Response
Write a short, engaging blog post based on this picture. It should include a description of the meal in the photo and talk about my journey meal prepping.


Cookies	
Meal prepping is a great way to save time and money, and it can also help you to eat healthier. This meal is a great example of a healthy and delicious meal that can be easily prepped ahead of time.

This meal features brown rice, roasted vegetables, and chicken teriyaki. The brown rice is a healthy and complex carbohydrate that will give you sustained energy. The roasted vegetables are a great way to get your daily dose of vitamins and minerals, and the chicken teriyaki is a delicious and protein-rich option.

This meal is also very easy to prepare. Simply cook the brown rice, roast the vegetables, and cook the chicken teriyaki. Once everything is cooked, divide it into meal prep containers and store them in the refrigerator. You can then grab a container and go on busy mornings!

If you're looking for a healthy and delicious meal that can be easily prepped ahead of time, this meal is a great option. It's packed with nutrients and flavor, and it's sure to keep you feeling full and satisfied.

Here's to healthy and delicious meal prepping!

If you are having trouble getting the output you want from prompts that use media files, there are some strategies that can help you get the results you want. The following sections provide design approaches and troubleshooting tips for improving prompts that use multimodal input.

You can improve your multimodal prompts by following these best practices:

Prompt design fundamentals
Be specific in your instructions: Craft clear and concise instructions that leave minimal room for misinterpretation.
Add a few examples to your prompt: Use realistic few-shot examples to illustrate what you want to achieve.
Break it down step-by-step: Divide complex tasks into manageable sub-goals, guiding the model through the process.
Specify the output format: In your prompt, ask for the output to be in the format you want, like markdown, JSON, HTML and more.
Put your image first for single-image prompts: While Gemini can handle image and text inputs in any order, for prompts containing a single image, it might perform better if that image (or video) is placed before the text prompt. However, for prompts that require images to be highly interleaved with texts to make sense, use whatever order is most natural.
Troubleshooting your multimodal prompt
If the model is not drawing information from the relevant part of the image: Drop hints with which aspects of the image you want the prompt to draw information from.
If the model output is too generic (not tailored enough to the image/video input): At the start of the prompt, try asking the model to describe the image(s) or video before providing the task instruction, or try asking the model to refer to what's in the image.
To troubleshoot which part failed: Ask the model to describe the image, or ask the model to explain its reasoning, to gauge the model's initial understanding.
If your prompt results in hallucinated content: Try dialing down the temperature setting or asking the model for shorter descriptions so that it's less likely to extrapolate additional details.
Tuning the sampling parameters: Experiment with different temperature settings and top-k selections to adjust the model's creativity.
Be specific in your instructions
Prompts have the most success when they are clear and detailed. If you have a specific output in mind, it's better to include that requirement in the prompt to ensure you get the output you want.

For this image of an airport board, asking the model to just "describe this image" could generate a general description. If you need the model to parse the time and city from the image, you can include that request directly in your prompt.

Prompt	Model response

Describe this image.

The image shows an airport arrivals and departures board.

Updated prompt	Improved response
Travel timetable
Parse the time and city from the airport board shown in this image into a list.

10:50 Moscow
11:05 Edinburgh
11:05 London
11:10 Bucharest
11:30 Kiev
11:35 Dublin
11:45 East Midlands
12:15 Sofia
12:30 London
12:30 Newcastle
12:40 St Petersburg
12:40 London
12:45 Manchester
Add a few examples
The Gemini model can accept multiple inputs which it can use as examples to understand the output you want. Adding these examples can help the model identify the patterns and apply the relationship between the given images and responses to the new example. This is also called "few-shot" learning.

In the example below, the initial output is written in sentence form, and also contains the country (Brazil). Suppose you want the output in a different format or style, and you want only the city, not the country. Adding few-shot examples to your prompt can steer the model to respond in the way you want.

Prompt	Model response
Travel timetable
Determine the city along with the landmark.

The landmark is the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Updated prompt	Improved response
Determine the city along with the landmark.

colosseum	
city: Rome, landmark: the Colosseum.

Forbidden City	
city: Beijing, landmark: Forbidden City

forbidden-city	
city: Rio de Janeiro, landmark: Christ the Redeemer statue

Break it down step-by-step
For complex tasks like the ones that require both visual understanding and reasoning, it can be helpful to split the task into smaller, more straightforward steps. Alternatively, it could also be effective if you directly ask the model to ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù in your prompt.

Prompt	Model response

When will I run out of toilet paper?

Soon, you only have 3 rolls left.

Updated prompt	Improved response


1. First, count how many toilet paper rolls are in this picture.
2. Then, determine how much toilet paper a typical person uses per day.
3. Calculate how long these rolls of toilet paper will last.

1. There are 3 rolls of toilet paper in this picture.
2. A typical person uses about 20 sheets of toilet paper per day.
3. If each roll contains 200 sheets, then each roll will last for about 10 days. Therefore, the 3 rolls will last for about a month.
Math problems or other types of word problems are great candidates for asking the model to think step-by-step.

Prompt	Response


What is the 4th term in the sequence?

-135

The response from the model is incorrect. Some ways to improve this is to ask the model to parse the problem before answering the prompt.

Prompt	Response


Parse the formula in the image first.

Then based on the formula, answer "what's the 4th term in the sequence?".

Click to expand the result
This model response is correct - now to make the response even more streamlined, you can ask the model to to think step-by-step.

Updated prompt	Improved response

What is the 4th term in the sequence? Think step by step.

The first term is 15.

The second term is b(1) * (-3) = 15 * (-3) = -45.

The third term is b(2) * (-3) = -45 * (-3) = 135.

The fourth term is b(3) * (-3) = 135 * (-3) = -405.

Specify the output format
A common problem is the need for model output to be in a certain format (e.g. markdown, JSON, HTML), especially if the model output needs to be ingested by a downstream task. You can try to produce output in that format by instructing the model to do so within the prompt. Below are two examples:

Prompt	Model response

Parse the table in this image into markdown format

| Subject | Status | Time | Start date | Due on |

| ------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ------ |

| Math | Done | 1.5 hrs | 11/29/2023 | 12/1/2023 |

| Geography | Done | 30 min | 12/2/2023 | 12/4/2023 |

| Physics | In progress | 2 hrs | 12/3/2023 | 12/5/2023 |

| Biology | Not started | 6 hrs | 11/2/2016 | 12/6/2023 |

Prompt	Model response

Provide a list of all the following attributes:

ingredients, type of cuisine, vegetarian or not, in JSON format


```json

{

"ingredients": [

"rice",
"shrimp",
"clams",
"mussels",
"peas",
"tomatoes",
"onions",
"garlic",
"olive oil",
"paprika",
"salt",
"pepper"

],
"type of cuisine": "Spanish",
"vegetarian": false

}

```

Put your image first for single-image prompts
While Gemini can interpret image and text in any order within a prompt, placing a single image before the text prompt might lead to better results. In the following samples, you'll notice the image comes first before the text in each prompt.

Troubleshooting your multimodal prompt
You might need to troubleshoot your prompt if you are not getting a helpful response. Here are a few strategies you could try.

If the model is not drawing information from the relevant part of the image
To get a more specific response, you can point out which aspects of the image you want the prompt to draw information from to inform its response.

Prompt	Model response

How many days will these diapers last a baby?

The diapers will last for 198 days before they run out.

Updated prompt	Improved response

How long will these diapers last before I run out?

Use the weight shown on the box to determine the child's age, and use the total number of diapers in the box.

Divide the total number by how many diapers the child goes through per day.

The box contains 198 diapers. The box states the diapers are for a child weighing 22-37 lbs.

The average child in this weight range is likely between 1 and 2 years old.

A 2-year-old typically goes through 6 diapers per day, therefore, the diapers will last around 33 days (198/6).

If the model output is too generic and not tailored enough to the image input
To help the model tailor its response to the image(s), try asking it to describe the images before performing its reasoning task.

Prompt	Model response
   
What is in common between these images?

All four images are examples of landscape photography.

Updated prompt	Improved response
   
First, describe what's in each image in detail. What's in common between these images?

The first image shows a person packing a suitcase. The second image shows an empty hallway in a shopping mall. The third image shows a roll of toilet paper. The fourth image shows a dark and stormy sea.

The commonality between these images is that they are all examples of liminal spaces. Liminal spaces are places or situations that are in between two other places or situations. They are often characterized by a sense of uncertainty or ambiguity.

The first image shows the person in between being at home and being on a trip. The second image shows the hallway in between two stores. The third image is of toilet paper, which can represent a bathroom. A bathroom is a transitional space between private and public realms. It's a place where we prepare ourselves to enter or leave the outside world.

The fourth image shows the sea in between being calm and being stormy.

Liminal spaces can be both exciting and unsettling. They can be a place of new beginning or a place of endings. They can be a place of reflection or a place of action.

You can also try explicitly asking the model to refer to what's in the image.

Updated prompt	Improved response
   
What is in common between these images? Refer to what's in the images in your response.

All of the images are related to travel. The first image shows a person packing a suitcase, the second image shows an empty hallway in a shopping mall, the third image shows a stack of toilet paper, and the fourth image shows a dark and stormy sea.

These images are all related to travel because they are all things that people need or use when they travel. The first image shows a person packing a suitcase, which is something that people do when they are going on a trip. The second image shows an empty hallway in a shopping mall, which is a place where people often go to buy things for their trips. The third image shows a stack of toilet paper, which is something that people often use when they are traveling. The fourth image shows a dark and stormy sea, which is something that people often encounter when they are traveling.

The same tips work for creative output from images. In the following example with the rabbit, explicitly asking the model to include aspects from the image can improve the output.

Prompt	Model response

Can you write me a poem about this image?

Little bunny, so soft and brown,
Hopping through the field, up and down.
Your ears so long, your tail so small,
You're the cutest creature of them all.

You nibble on the grass, so green and sweet,
And hop away when you see me.
But I'll always be your friend,
Little bunny, until the very end.

Updated prompt	Improved response

Can you write me a descriptive and dramatic poem about this image and include the location?

Little bunny on the green,
Ears so long, so keen.
What do you see out there,
In the distance, where you stare?

Is it the ocean blue,
Sparkling in the sun's hue?
Or the waves that crash and roar,
A rhythm that you adore?

Little bunny, tell me true,
What captures your attention so?
Is it the salty breeze,
Or the seagulls' cries that please?

Perhaps it's the vastness of it all,
A world so big and small.
A place where dreams can roam,
And adventures can be sown.

Little bunny, I wonder what you dream,
As you sit on the grass, so serene.
Do you yearn to explore the deep,
Or stay on land, where you can leap?

Whatever it may be, little bunny,
Keep that spark of wonder burning brightly.
For in your dreams and aspirations,
Lies a world waiting for your creation.

Troubleshooting which part of the prompt failed
It can be hard to know whether a prompt failed because the model didn't understand the image to begin with, or if it did understand the image but did not perform the correct reasoning steps afterward. To disambiguate between those reasons, ask the model to describe what's in the image.

In the following example, if the model responds with a snack that seems surprising when paired with tea (e.g. popcorn), you can first troubleshoot to determine whether the model correctly recognized that the image contains tea.

Prompt	Prompt for troubleshooting

What's a snack I can make in 1 minute that would go well with this?


Describe what's in this image.

Another strategy is to ask the model to explain its reasoning. That can help you narrow down which part of the reasoning broke down, if any.

Prompt	Prompt for troubleshooting

What's a snack I can make in 1 minute that would go well with this?


What's a snack I can make in 1 minute that would go well with this? Please explain why.

After (Centralized Client Object)

Python
JavaScript
Go

from google import genai

# Create a single client object
client = genai.Client()

# Access API methods through services on the client object

Migrate to the Google GenAI SDK

Starting with the Gemini 2.0 release in late 2024, we introduced a new set of libraries called the Google GenAI SDK. It offers an improved developer experience through an updated client architecture, and simplifies the transition between developer and enterprise workflows.

The Google GenAI SDK is now in General Availability (GA) across all supported platforms. If you're using one of our legacy libraries, we strongly recommend you to migrate.

This guide provides before-and-after examples of migrated code to help you get started.

Note: The Go examples omit imports and other boilerplate code to improve readability.
Installation
Before

Python
JavaScript
Go

pip install -U -q "google-generativeai"
After

Python
JavaScript
Go

pip install -U -q "google-genai"
API access
The old SDK implicitly handled the API client behind the scenes using a variety of ad hoc methods. This made it hard to manage the client and credentials. Now, you interact through a central Client object. This Client object acts as a single entry point for various API services (e.g., models, chats, files, tunings), promoting consistency and simplifying credential and configuration management across different API calls.

Before (Less Centralized API Access)

Python
JavaScript
Go
The old SDK didn't explicitly use a top-level client object for most API calls. You would directly instantiate and interact with GenerativeModel objects.


import google.generativeai as genai

# Directly create and use model objects
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content(...)
chat = model.start_chat(...)
After (Centralized Client Object)

Python
JavaScript
Go

from google import genai

# Create a single client object
client = genai.Client()

# Access API methods through services on the client object
response = client.models.generate_content(...)
chat = client.chats.create(...)
my_file = client.files.upload(...)
tuning_job = client.tunings.tune(...)
Authentication
Both legacy and new libraries authenticate using API keys. You can create your API key in Google AI Studio.

Before

Python
JavaScript
Go
The old SDK handled the API client object implicitly.


import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=...)
After

Python
JavaScript
Go
With Google GenAI SDK, you create an API client first, which is used to call the API. The new SDK will pick up your API key from either one of the GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variables, if you don't pass one to the client.


export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

from google import genai

client = genai.Client() # Set the API key using the GEMINI_API_KEY env var.
                        # Alternatively, you could set the API key explicitly:
                        # client = genai.Client(api_key="your_api_key")
Generate content
Text
Before

Python
JavaScript
Go
Previously, there were no client objects, you accessed APIs directly through GenerativeModel objects.


import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content(
    'Tell me a story in 300 words'
)
print(response.text)
After

Python
JavaScript
Go
The new Google GenAI SDK provides access to all the API methods through the Client object. Except for a few stateful special cases (chat and live-api sessions), these are all stateless functions. For utility and uniformity, objects returned are pydantic classes.


from google import genai
client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents='Tell me a story in 300 words.'
)
print(response.text)

print(response.model_dump_json(
    exclude_none=True, indent=4))
Image
Before

Python
JavaScript
Go

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content([
    'Tell me a story based on this image',
    Image.open(image_path)
])
print(response.text)
After

Python
JavaScript
Go
Many of the same convenience features exist in the new SDK. For example, PIL.Image objects are automatically converted.


from google import genai
from PIL import Image

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=[
        'Tell me a story based on this image',
        Image.open(image_path)
    ]
)
print(response.text)
Streaming
Before

Python
JavaScript
Go

import google.generativeai as genai

response = model.generate_content(
    "Write a cute story about cats.",
    stream=True)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text)
After

Python
JavaScript
Go

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

for chunk in client.models.generate_content_stream(
  model='gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents='Tell me a story in 300 words.'
):
    print(chunk.text)
Configuration
Before

Python
JavaScript
Go

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
  'gemini-1.5-flash',
    system_instruction='you are a story teller for kids under 5 years old',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
      max_output_tokens=400,
      top_k=2,
      top_p=0.5,
      temperature=0.5,
      response_mime_type='application/json',
      stop_sequences=['\n'],
    )
)
response = model.generate_content('tell me a story in 100 words')
After

Python
JavaScript
Go
For all methods in the new SDK, the required arguments are provided as keyword arguments. All optional inputs are provided in the config argument. Config arguments can be specified as either Python dictionaries or Config classes in the google.genai.types namespace. For utility and uniformity, all definitions within the types module are pydantic classes.


from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
  model='gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents='Tell me a story in 100 words.',
  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      system_instruction='you are a story teller for kids under 5 years old',
      max_output_tokens= 400,
      top_k= 2,
      top_p= 0.5,
      temperature= 0.5,
      response_mime_type= 'application/json',
      stop_sequences= ['\n'],
      seed=42,
  ),
)
Safety settings
Generate a response with safety settings:

Before

Python
JavaScript

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content(
    'say something bad',
    safety_settings={
        'HATE': 'BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH',
        'HARASSMENT': 'BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH',
  }
)
After

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
  model='gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents='say something bad',
  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      safety_settings= [
          types.SafetySetting(
              category='HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH',
              threshold='BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH'
          ),
      ]
  ),
)
Async
Before

Python

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content_async(
    'tell me a story in 100 words'
)
After

Python
To use the new SDK with asyncio, there is a separate async implementation of every method under client.aio.


from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

response = await client.aio.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents='Tell me a story in 300 words.'
)
Chat
Start a chat and send a message to the model:

Before

Python
JavaScript
Go

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
chat = model.start_chat()

response = chat.send_message(
    "Tell me a story in 100 words")
response = chat.send_message(
    "What happened after that?")
After

Python
JavaScript
Go

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')

response = chat.send_message(
    message='Tell me a story in 100 words')
response = chat.send_message(
    message='What happened after that?')
Function calling
Before

Python

import google.generativeai as genai
from enum import Enum

def get_current_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current whether in a given location.

    Args:
        location: required, The city and state, e.g. San Franciso, CA
        unit: celsius or fahrenheit
    """
    print(f'Called with: {location=}')
    return "23C"

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    tools=[get_current_weather]
)

response = model.generate_content("What is the weather in San Francisco?")
function_call = response.candidates[0].parts[0].function_call
After

Python
In the new SDK, automatic function calling is the default. Here, you disable it.


from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

def get_current_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current whether in a given location.

    Args:
        location: required, The city and state, e.g. San Franciso, CA

    print(f'Called with: {location=}')
    return "23C"

response = client.models.generate_content(
  model='gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents="What is the weather like in Boston?",
  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      tools=[get_current_weather],
      automatic_function_calling={'disable': True},
  ),
)

function_call = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].function_call
Automatic function calling
Before

Python
The old SDK only supports automatic function calling in chat. In the new SDK this is the default behavior in generate_content.


import google.generativeai as genai

def get_current_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return "23C"

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    tools=[get_current_weather]
)

chat = model.start_chat(
    enable_automatic_function_calling=True)
result = chat.send_message("What is the weather in San Francisco?")
After

Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
client = genai.Client()

def get_current_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return "23C"

response = client.models.generate_content(
  model='gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents="What is the weather like in Boston?",
  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      tools=[get_current_weather]
  ),
)
Code execution
Code execution is a tool that allows the model to generate Python code, run it, and return the result.

Before

Python
JavaScript

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    tools="code_execution"
)

result = model.generate_content(
  "What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers? Generate and run code for "
  "the calculation, and make sure you get all 50.")
After

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents='What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers? Generate and run '
            'code for the calculation, and make sure you get all 50.',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[types.Tool(code_execution=types.ToolCodeExecution)],
    ),
)
Search grounding
GoogleSearch (Gemini>=2.0) and GoogleSearchRetrieval (Gemini < 2.0) are tools that allow the model to retrieve public web data for grounding, powered by Google.

Before

Python

import google.generativeai as genai

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content(
    contents="what is the Google stock price?",
    tools='google_search_retrieval'
)
After

Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents='What is the Google stock price?',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[
            types.Tool(
                google_search=types.GoogleSearch()
            )
        ]
    )
)
JSON response
Generate answers in JSON format.

Before

Python
JavaScript
By specifying a response_schema and setting response_mime_type="application/json" users can constrain the model to produce a JSON response following a given structure.


import google.generativeai as genai
import typing_extensions as typing

class CountryInfo(typing.TypedDict):
    name: str
    population: int
    capital: str
    continent: str
    major_cities: list[str]
    gdp: int
    official_language: str
    total_area_sq_mi: int

model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="gemini-1.5-flash")
result = model.generate_content(
    "Give me information of the United States",
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema = CountryInfo
    ),
)
After

Python
JavaScript
The new SDK uses pydantic classes to provide the schema (although you can pass a genai.types.Schema, or equivalent dict). When possible, the SDK will parse the returned JSON, and return the result in response.parsed. If you provided a pydantic class as the schema the SDK will convert that JSON to an instance of the class.


from google import genai
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = genai.Client()

class CountryInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    population: int
    capital: str
    continent: str
    major_cities: list[str]
    gdp: int
    official_language: str
    total_area_sq_mi: int

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents='Give me information of the United States.',
    config={
        'response_mime_type': 'application/json',
        'response_schema': CountryInfo,
    },
)

response.parsed
Files
Upload
Upload a file:

Before

Python

import requests
import pathlib
import google.generativeai as genai

# Download file
response = requests.get(
    'https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/a11.txt')
pathlib.Path('a11.txt').write_text(response.text)

file = genai.upload_file(path='a11.txt')

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content([
    'Can you summarize this file:',

Generate images using Imagen

Imagen is Google's high-fidelity image generation model, capable of generating realistic and high quality images from text prompts. All generated images include a SynthID watermark. To learn more about the available Imagen model variants, see the Model versions section.

Note: You can also generate images with Gemini's built-in multimodal capabilities. See the Image generation guide for details.
Generate images using the Imagen models
This example demonstrates generating images with an Imagen model:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

async function main() {

  const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

  const response = await ai.models.generateImages({
    model: 'imagen-4.0-generate-preview-06-06',
    prompt: 'Robot holding a red skateboard',
    config: {
      numberOfImages: 4,
    },
  });

  let idx = 1;
  for (const generatedImage of response.generatedImages) {
    let imgBytes = generatedImage.image.imageBytes;
    const buffer = Buffer.from(imgBytes, "base64");
    fs.writeFileSync(`imagen-${idx}.png`, buffer);
    idx++;
  }
}

main();
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
Imagen configuration
Imagen supports English only prompts at this time and the following parameters:

Note: Naming conventions of parameters vary by programming language.
numberOfImages: The number of images to generate, from 1 to 4 (inclusive). The default is 4. For Imagen 4 Ultra, it defaults to 1 as only one image can be generated at a time.
aspectRatio: Changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. Supported values are "1:1", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", and "16:9". The default is "1:1".
personGeneration: Allow the model to generate images of people. The following values are supported:

"dont_allow": Block generation of images of people.
"allow_adult": Generate images of adults, but not children. This is the default.
"allow_all": Generate images that include adults and children.

Text generation

The Gemini API can generate text output from various inputs, including text, images, video, and audio, leveraging Gemini models.

Here's a basic example that takes a single text input:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();

Thinking with Gemini 2.5
2.5 Flash and Pro models have "thinking" enabled by default to enhance quality, which may take longer to run and increase token usage.

When using 2.5 Flash, you can disable thinking by setting the thinking budget to zero.

For more details, see the thinking guide.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 0, // Disables thinking
      },
    }
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
System instructions and other configurations
You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a GenerateContentConfig object.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Hello there",
    config: {
      systemInstruction: "You are a cat. Your name is Neko.",
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
The GenerateContentConfig object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as temperature.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
    config: {
      temperature: 0.1,
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
Refer to the GenerateContentConfig in our API reference for a complete list of configurable parameters and their descriptions.

Multimodal inputs
The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs, allowing you to combine text with media files. The following example demonstrates providing an image:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import {
  GoogleGenAI,
  createUserContent,
  createPartFromUri,
} from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const image = await ai.files.upload({
    file: "/path/to/organ.png",
  });
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: [
      createUserContent([
        "Tell me about this instrument",
        createPartFromUri(image.uri, image.mimeType),
      ]),
    ],
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
For alternative methods of providing images and more advanced image processing, see our image understanding guide. The API also supports document, video, and audio inputs and understanding.

Streaming responses
By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive GenerateContentResponse instances incrementally as they're generated.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
  });

  for await (const chunk of response) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
  }
}

await main();
Multi-turn conversations (Chat)
Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.

Note: Chat functionality is only implemented as part of the SDKs. Behind the scenes, it still uses the generateContent API. For multi-turn conversations, the full conversation history is sent to the model with each follow-up turn.
Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const response1 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 1:", response1.text);

  const response2 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 2:", response2.text);
}

await main();
Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const stream1 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream1) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }

  const stream2 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream2) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }
}

await main();
Supported models
All models in the Gemini family support text generation. To learn more about the models and their capabilities, visit the Models page.

Best practices
Prompting tips
For basic text generation, a zero-shot prompt often suffices without needing examples, system instructions or specific formatting.

For more tailored outputs:

Use System instructions to guide the model.
Provide few example inputs and outputs to guide the model. This is often referred to as few-shot prompting.
Consult our prompt engineering guide for more tips.

Structured output
In some cases, you may need structured output, such as JSON. Refer to our structured output guide to learn how.
